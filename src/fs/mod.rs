//! A capability-based filesystem API modeled after `std::fs`.
//!
//! This corresponds to [`std::fs`].
//!
//! Instead of [`std::fs`'s free functions] which operate on paths, this
//! crate has methods on [`Dir`] which operate on paths which must be
//! relative to and within the directory.
//!
//! Since all functions which expose raw file descriptors are `unsafe`,
//! I/O handles in this API are unforgeable (unsafe code notwithstanding).
//! This combined a absolute paths provides a natural capability-oriented
//! interface.
