//! TODO: Rust's `Path` has several ambient-authority methods: `metadata`,
//! `read_link`, `read_dir`, `symlink_metadata`, `canonicalize`. Is it
//! worth having our own version of `Path` just to exclude those? Such a
//! thing could also exclude absolute paths.
//!
//! On WASI, use of this library more closely reflects the underlying
//! system API, so it avoids the absolute-path compatibility layers.
